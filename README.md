I had the idea of building a simple circuit that can detect its Orientation using an MPU6050 gyroscope and used that input data on a Processing app to simulate the gun's aim point and added some randomly generated squares to shoot at!

Goal for V1.2.0:(coming soon)
- Add reload functionality
- Create a playable game with graphics in Processing
- reduce callibration time and simplfy process
